# Student Management Backend

## Database Migrations

This project uses [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/guide/) for database migrations. 
The following commands are available for managing database migrations:

### Creating a New Migration
To create a new migration file:
```bash
docker-compose exec api npm run migrate:create -- <migration-name>
```
Example:
```bash
docker-compose exec api npm run migrate:create -- add_email_to_students
```

### Running Migrations
To run all pending migrations:
```bash
docker-compose exec api npm run migrate:latest
```

To run the next pending migration:
```bash
docker-compose exec api npm run migrate:up
```

To rollback the last migration:
```bash
docker-compose exec api npm run migrate:down
```

To rollback all migrations:
```bash
docker-compose exec api npm run migrate:rollback
```

## Development
The backend server runs in development mode with hot-reloading enabled.
Any changes to the source code will automatically restart the server.
